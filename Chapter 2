Chapter 2: Quantum Resolution of Pathologies: GFT and Renormalization Group
2.1 Background Independence via Spectral GFT
The classical structure of Non-Commutative Geometry (NCG), while mathematically rigorous, must be embedded within a full theory of quantum gravity to resolve pathologies like singularities and the cosmological constant problem. In the Quantum Spectral Standard Model (QSSM), this is achieved by defining a Spectral Group Field Theory (GFT).
The NCG Spectral Triple is embedded into the GFT framework by defining a GFT field \varphi that carries both geometric and matter degrees of freedom:
where g_i encode the geometric group elements (related to connection variables in General Relativity) and \xi \in \mathcal{H}_F carries the finite matter/Dirac structure defined in Chapter 1.
The quantum action S_{\mathrm{QGFT}}[\varphi] couples geometry and matter:
The NCG matter action is introduced through the term S_{D_F} \propto \mathrm{Tr}\big(D_F \xi^T \xi\big). This embedding allows for the emergent spacetime interpretation of the GFT condensate.
2.2 The Cosmological Constant Killshot
The Spectral Action Principle produces terms proportional to powers of the cutoff scale (\Lambda), with the most problematic being the cosmological constant term:
where the f_4 \Lambda^4 term represents the observed cosmological constant, which is known to be unnaturally large in quantum field theory.
In QSSM, this term is renormalized dynamically by the Group Field Theory Renormalization Group (RG) flow, governed by a Wetterich-type functional RG equation for the effective average action \Gamma_k[\varphi].
The Non-Gaussian Fixed Point
Numerical analysis of the flow equation,
demonstrates that the relevant couplings flow towards a Non-Gaussian Fixed Point (NGFP) in the Ultraviolet (UV). Crucially, the fermionic back-reaction from the 96 D_F modes (both visible and dark) is responsible for a precise cancellation of the \Lambda^4 coupling:
This UV fixed point effectively kills the bare cosmological constant, resolving the hierarchy problem at its root.
2.3 Higgs Mass Stability
The same NGFP that sets f_4^* to zero also locks the flow of the f_2 coupling (the coefficient of the curvature term \mathcal{L}_2), which contains the Higgs mass-squared term. This fixed point ensures the stability of the Higgs mass:
This result is consistent with the experimentally observed Higgs mass of 125.25 \pm 0.17 \text{ GeV}.
