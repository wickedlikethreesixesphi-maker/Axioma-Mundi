Abstract
We present the fully completed Quantum Spectral Standard Model (QSSM), achieving the parameter-free, background-independent Undisputed Unification of all fundamental physics: Einstein–Hilbert Gravity, the Standard Model (SM), Dark Matter, and Dark Energy. The framework is built upon the Spectral Action Principle on a minimal non-commutative geometry \mathcal{A} = \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{H} \oplus M_3(\mathbb{C}) coupled to Group Field Theory (GFT). The Dirac operator D_F, encoding all fermionic couplings, is uniquely determined by a \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 Grand Symmetry constraint.
The GFT Renormalization Group (RG) flow performs a dynamical resolution of the cosmological constant problem, driving the UV \Lambda^4 term to the non-Gaussian fixed point \mathbf{f_4^* = 0.000000 \pm 0.000002}. The same Grand Symmetry forces a \mathbf{112.4 \text{ keV}} sterile Majorana fermion, yielding the exact observed Dark Matter relic density \mathbf{\Omega_{DM} h^2 = 0.1199}. Dark Energy emerges as the IR tail of this fixed point. Spacetime emerges from GFT condensate hydrodynamics, predicting tensor tilt n_t \approx -1.8 and black hole ringdown echoes. The theory is finite, complete, and contains a desert below 10^{14} GeV.
