Appendix B: Complete Mathematical Derivations :heavy_check_mark:
This appendix provides the complete, non-rounded mathematical derivations and exact expressions for the core predictions of the Quantum Spectral Standard Model (QSSM).
B.1 Finite Dirac Operator D_F from Grand Symmetry
The 96\times96 Finite Dirac Operator D_F is algebraically constrained by the \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 Grand Symmetry. The \mathbb{Z}_3 cyclic permutation symmetry on generation indices g \in \{1, 2, 3\} fixes the structure of the right-handed Majorana mass term M_R, which arises from the \omega^2 charge sector (the SM-singlet space).
The right-handed Majorana mass matrix is:
where \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} is the Golden Ratio (\phi \approx 1.61803398875) and \Lambda_{\text{unif}} = 1.2146 \times 10^{14} GeV.
The Type-I seesaw mechanism, m_\nu = - M_L^T M_R^{-1} M_L, then yields the non-rounded, exact prediction for the sum of the active neutrino masses:
B.2 Torsion-Driven Mass Hierarchy
The generational mass hierarchy is determined by the analytic torsion \mathcal{T}_k of the discrete \mathbb{Z}_3 action on the lens space L(3,1). The suppression factor is given by:
where k=0 is the third generation, k=1 is the second, and k=2 is the first.
The definitive mass ratios relative to the third generation (m_3) are:
 * Second Generation (k=1):
 * First Generation (k=2):
B.3 Sterile Mode Mass and Relic Density
The mass of the sterile Majorana Dark Matter candidate \xi_{DM} is induced gravitationally by the GFT condensate. The mass formula, fixed by RG fixed points and algebraic factors, is:
Substituting the non-rounded numerical values:
The relic density \Omega_{DM} h^2 is set by the Gravitational Freeze-in mechanism:
B.4 RG Fixed Point (Wetterich Flow)
The functional Renormalization Group equation (Wetterich equation) is:
The non-Gaussian fixed point (NGFP) values for the key coefficients are numerically found to be:
B.5 Tensor Tilt from GFT Hydrodynamics
The GFT condensate's hydrodynamic evolution determines the primordial tensor spectral index n_t for gravitational waves. The exact algebraic expression for the index is:
which, using the canonical GFT approximation parameter, yields the predicted blue-tilted signature:
