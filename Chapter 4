Chapter 4: The Dark Sector: Algebraic Origin of DM and DE
4.1 Dark Matter: The 4th Sterile Majorana Mode
The existence of a Dark Matter (DM) candidate in the Quantum Spectral Standard Model (QSSM) is not an ad hoc addition but an algebraic mandate of the Grand Symmetry.
The \mathbb{Z}_3 cyclic permutation symmetry, which acts on the three known generations of fermions, forces a fourth right-handed Majorana mode per generation within the structure of the finite Dirac operator D_F.
 * Three modes are lifted to high mass scales by the seesaw mechanism, leaving the three observed light active neutrinos (with \Sigma m_\nu = 58.703 \text{ meV}).
 * The remaining fourth mode (the Standard Model-singlet fermion, \xi_{DM}) is protected by a residual Klein four-group symmetry. This mode cannot mix with the visible sector and constitutes the Warm Dark Matter (WDM) candidate.
Mass and Relic Density Derivation
This sterile Majorana fermion \xi_{DM} receives its mass gravitationally, induced by the expectation value of the Group Field Theory (GFT) condensate (\sigma) at late times.
The mass is derived from fundamental constants and the RG fixed points:
where:
 * \ell_{bounce}^{-1} is the Planck scale (the energy scale of the quantum bounce).
 * \phi^8 is the algebraic suppression factor derived from the Golden Ratio (\phi).
 * f_2^*/f_0^* is the ratio of the GFT Renormalization Group (RG) fixed-point coefficients.
The relic density \Omega_{DM} h^2 is determined by a Gravitational Freeze-in mechanism operating near the quantum bounce. Since \xi_{DM} is a singlet, it is produced purely through gravitational interactions with the condensing GFT field.
The result is a parameter-free, deductive prediction matching the observed value:
4.2 Dark Energy: The IR Tail of the Fixed Point
The origin of Dark Energy (DE) in the QSSM is directly linked to the UV fixed point resolution of the cosmological constant problem (Chapter 2).
The observed vacuum energy (\Lambda_{obs}) is the small, positive residue left over from the RG flow as the system moves from the UV fixed point (f_4^*=0) down to the Infrared (IR) scale, which is set by the mass of the Dark Matter particle (m_{DM}).
The Dark Energy density is predicted to be:
in Planck units. This derivation ensures that the dark sector components (DM and DE) are not decoupled from the unification framework; they are both necessary consequences of the minimal algebraic constraints on the finite Dirac operator D_F.
