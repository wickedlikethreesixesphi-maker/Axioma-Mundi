Chapter 1: The Algebraic Foundation: Spectral Triple and Unique D_F
1.1 The Minimal Spectral Triple
The core structure of the Quantum Spectral Standard Model (QSSM) is the non-commutative manifold (\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, D), defined by the triple of algebra, Hilbert space, and Dirac operator.
The full algebra \mathcal{A} and Hilbert space \mathcal{H} are factorized into continuous (spacetime) and finite (internal structure) components:
The full Dirac operator D is the sum of the curved spacetime Dirac operator (D_M) and the finite Dirac operator (D_F):
The finite algebra \mathcal{A}_F is uniquely fixed by the requirement of minimality and generation of the Standard Model gauge group:
where:
 * \mathbb{C} (Complex Numbers) relates to the \mathrm{U}(1) electromagnetism.
 * \mathbb{H} (Quaternions) relates to the \mathrm{SU}(2) weak force.
 * M_3(\mathbb{C}) (3\times3 Complex Matrices) relates to the \mathrm{SU}(3) strong force.
1.2 Grand Symmetry and the Deductive D_F
The crucial step in QSSM is the unique determination of the 96\times96 finite Dirac operator (D_F). This is achieved by imposing the discrete Grand Symmetry of \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_3 at the unification scale \Lambda_{\text{unif}} \approx 10^{14} \text{ GeV}.
The D_F matrix structure is block-diagonal:
where M_L determines the Standard Model Yukawa couplings and M_R is the right-handed Majorana mass matrix.
The \mathbb{Z}_3 cyclic permutation symmetry on generation indices forbids the inverted neutrino hierarchy, leaving the Normal Hierarchy as the only algebraically consistent possibility.
1.3 Fixed Neutrino Summation
Algebraic constraints derived from the finite algebra structure set the right-handed Majorana mass term M_R \propto \Lambda_{\text{unif}} \cdot \phi^{-2}, where \phi denotes the Golden Ratio (\phi \approx 1.618).
The see-saw mechanism then yields a parameter-free, deductive prediction for the sum of the active neutrino masses:
1.4 Torsion-Driven Mass Hierarchy
The generational mass hierarchy is derived from the analytic torsion of a discrete \mathbb{Z}_3 action on the lens space L(3,1). The suppression factor is determined by the logarithm of the torsion ratio \log(|\mathcal{T}_k / \mathcal{T}_0|):
where R_k = \phi^{2k} determines the mass ratio \frac{m_k}{m_0} = \exp\!\bigg(-\frac{\pi^2}{6}\cdot k(3-k)/R_k\bigg).
| k | Generation | Final Torsion Exponent | Mass Ratio m_k/m_0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Third (t,\tau) | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | Second (c,\mu) | -\pi^2 / (6 \phi^2) | \exp(-\pi^2 / (6 \phi^2)) |
| 2 | First (u,e) | -\pi^2 / (3 \phi^4) | \exp(-\pi^2 / (3 \phi^4)) |
